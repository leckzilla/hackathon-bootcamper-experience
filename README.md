## SoC Hackathon 22/5/20

**Theme - Something to enhance the bootcamper experience**

It's 5pm on Friday and therefore Pub O'Clock! Shenanigans is a bit of fun React app which will decide which of the many watering holes in Digbeth to retire to for some well-earned zesty beverages. You can also toggle to settle the age-old problem of who's round it is first and pick a member of your squad at random. You can also add to the bars/squad.
